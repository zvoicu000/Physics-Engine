# C# Physics Engine  
‚öôÔ∏è A custom-built physics engine developed in C# for realistic simulation of physical systems.

This project is a fully functional physics engine implemented in C#. It supports core physics concepts such as collision detection, rigid body dynamics, forces, and constraints. Designed for easy integration into games or simulations, the engine focuses on accuracy and performance.

## Features  
- Collision detection with multiple shapes  
- Rigid body physics simulation  
- Force application and numerical integration  
- Support for constraints and joints  
- Modular and extensible architecture

## Getting Started  

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.

3. To test the physics engine, run the `Game1.cs` MonoGame project which serves as a physics tester and demo scene.

4. You can also integrate the physics engine into your own MonoGame projects or any .NET applications.
